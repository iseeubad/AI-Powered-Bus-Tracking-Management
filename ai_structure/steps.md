# Step 1: define the ai objective
- core feature: Predict bus arrival time at the next stop;
- optional: detect delayed/off-route buses if we have time.
- inputs: busId, timestamp, location, speed
- outputs: predicted arrival time at next stop

# step 2: explore and prepare data
- pull historical telemetry data from Mongodb
- compute derived features:
    - Distance to next stop (use Haversine formula)
    - trip time between stops.
    - average speed per segment
    - time of day (peadk vs off-peak)
- clean the data (remvoe missing/ invalid entries)

# step 3: choose and train AI model
- start simple : linear regressino or RandomForest for travel time prediction.
- Optional upgrade: LSTM for sequence prediction if we have enough data and time.
- split data into train/test sets and evaluate with MAE (mean absolute error)
- iterage: test different features, model parameters, and check predicitons.

# step 4: wrap model into an API
- use Flask or FastAPI
- crate an endpoint: /predict-arrival that takes:
    - busId, 
    - current location,
    - timestamp
- returns: predictedd arrival time at next step
- test locally wiht sample data.

# steps 5: integrate with backend

- backedn calls AI servies when needed:
    - exemple : GET /api/buses/:busId/predict-arrival -> internally calls python AI API.
- backedn returns prediction to frontend
- optional: add WebSocket updates fro real-tiem predictions

# step 6: test and validat
- use mock or live telemetry to simulate real-time predicions
- check for reasonable predicitons and error handling.
- optional: add alerts for delayed/off-route buses

# step 7: Polish for hackathon
- ensure stable, demo-ready AI service
- prepare sample scenario for demo (show predictions vs actual)
- Visual impace matters: small table or chart in frontend showing predicted arrivales.
